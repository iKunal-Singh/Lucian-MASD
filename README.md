# Lucian-MASD
A project that focuses on understanding the principles of microservice architecture and system design. The project itself is a simple application that converts MP4 files to MP3 format, but the main goal is to demonstrate how a microservice-based architecture can be used to build a scalable and maintainable system.

The repository contains the source code for the various microservices that make up the MP4 to MP3 Converter system. These microservices are designed to handle specific tasks, such as file conversion, file storage, and user management. Each microservice is loosely coupled and communicates with other microservices through APIs, allowing for easy modification and testing of individual components.

The system design of the project uses several concepts such as load balancing, containerization and service discovery. The project also provides a demonstration of how to use different technologies such as Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS to deploy the microservices.

The repository also includes documentation and diagrams that explain the overall architecture of the system, as well as the design decisions that were made and the trade-offs that were considered. This makes the project a valuable resource for anyone looking to learn more about microservice architecture and system design.
